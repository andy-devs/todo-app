-   Add new todos to the list
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos

## My process

### Built with

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

I first tried to create elements with javascript and add them to the document. It wasn't very hard, but a little bit painful. Also I made drag and drop but I don't really know how to make it work on mobile. One of the hardest parts was theme change because you should get every element that you need to change the color in and manually change it. Well, it's not so hard, but time consuming and looks clunky. Overall, It was fun and challenging project and I enjoyed it!

### Continued development

I think I'll continue learning vanilla JS and building projects. Also I need to finally make my own website.
